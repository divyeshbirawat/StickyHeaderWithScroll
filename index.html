    <h2 class="large-text">Most of North America’s small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) recognize climate change as a serious threat to their operations, but upfront mitigation costs and other business priorities mean few have plans in place to fight it, according to the results of a climate change survey commissioned by the BMO Climate Institute</h2>
    <div class="sub-heading-container"><h4 class="sub-heading">Overview</h4></div>
    <p class="content-body">SMEs, which employ no more than 500 employees, account for more than 99 percent of businesses in the United States and over 98 percent in Canada. They employ approximately 70 percent of the total workforce and have been responsible for creating more than half of net new private sector jobs over the past few decades. Yet, despite being the backbone of the economy, these companies receive very little support from government and other external partners to mitigate the risks resulting from climate change.

      At the same time, SME greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are increasingly becoming a concern for their customers, as companies strive to eliminate emissions from their full product value chains. SMEs are also less able to manage the physical impacts of climate change, such as floods, droughts and extreme wind, which can damage infrastructure and disrupt supply chains.
      
      The BMO Climate Institute’s inaugural survey of SME executives’ views on climate change found that 69 percent of executives expect the physical impacts of global warming will disrupt their operations over the next five years, and almost a third of those companies say severe weather patterns are already creating challenges.</p>
      <p class="content-body">Our survey found that, despite experiencing the consequences of climate change, 72 percent of U.S. businesses have yet to take any formal steps to build resilience. In Canada, the number of businesses without a climate plan swells to 77 percent. What’s more, even if businesses felt they could make a difference in the fight against climate change, most are either unsure where to begin or are preoccupied with more immediate macroeconomic challenges to justify the cost.

        The BMO Climate Institute commissioned this survey to seek a deeper understanding of how small and medium-sized businesses – the backbone of the economy and fundamental participants in a successful energy transition – view climate change and its challenges. The results reveal that, unsurprisingly, many smaller companies lack the knowledge of where to begin when developing a climate strategy. As a bank whose ambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero economy, we are taking decisive action to work with governments in developing financing strategies that accelerate climate solutions and grow the capital stack available to SMEs. We’re also leading initiatives to provide clients with more insights and financing options to help them future-proof their businesses and thrive in the evolving climate landscape.</p>

    <p class="content-body">At COP27 in Egypt in early November, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world “is on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.” To be sure, our survey of more than 600 senior business leaders in the U.S. and Canada in the lead-up to COP27 illustrates that while business leaders share this concern, it’s not enough to compel them to act.<br/><br/>
    Most of the 71 percent of executives who said they are either somewhat or very concerned about climate change said they expect the greatest risks to their businesses will come in the form of increasingly unpredictable and severe weather events (44 percent) and on the potential of those events to disrupt operations (31 percent). When it comes to climate change impacting their business, fewer than half of executives said they think about greenhouse gas reductions, decarbonization strategies or transition risk.</p>
    <div class="sub-heading-container"><h4 class="sub-heading">Header: Reputational vs. Legal Concerns</h4></div>
    <p class="content-body">As governments and regulators ramp up pressure around environmental and sustainability standards and policies, the survey showed that the gap between viewing climate change as a reputational risk (almost 60 percent) versus a legal and regulatory one (58 and 53 percent for the U.S. and Canada, respectively) is closing. Only about a quarter of respondents did not forecast any climate-related legal issues over the next five years.

      Business leaders said that customer pressure, rather than legal or regulatory requirements, is the key factor in deciding whether to adopt a climate change policy. Of those businesses that have a climate plan, 36 percent (U.S.) and 35 percent (Canada) said it was to meet customer expectations, while just 27 percent (U.S.) and 35 percent (Canada) of business leaders said it was because of government regulation.
      
      Notably, almost a third of U.S. businesses with climate plans have them because they expect it will improve their profitability and/or share value. On both sides of the border, 21 percent of respondents said investor pressure influenced their decision to adopt a climate change policy.
      
      These findings further reinforce the conclusion that economic and commercial factors are the most important drivers to advancing climate action.</p>
      <div class="sub-heading-container"><h4 class="sub-heading">Header: Tough Sell in Tough Times</h4></div>
    <p class="content-body">The Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius was seen as an ambitious undertaking when it was adopted by 196 countries in 2015 and the U.S. in 2021. While some perceived this as overly ambitious, 41 percent of SME leaders in the U.S. and 49 percent in Canada believed the goals governments and regulators have been putting in place to meet Paris targets are achievable.

      Still, getting more small and medium-sized companies to act on climate change mitigation measures could be tough. Many executives surveyed said they are too distracted by near-term challenges – inflation, supply chain and labor issues – to advance their climate strategies.
      
      Faced with the prospect of a recession, economic survival is currently top of mind. This short-term focus may prevent smaller companies from strategically positioning themselves in what could become an accelerated transition to close the momentous gap between policy and government action today and what is required to achieve the Paris goal.
      
      More than 90 percent of business leaders in the U.S. and Canada said they were concerned or somewhat concerned about inflation and rising interest rates. In the U.S., four in five business leaders (80 percent) ranked supply chain bottlenecks as the next biggest concern, while climate change ranked on par with labor shortages amongst roughly 70 percent of executives. In Canada, climate change was further down the priority list at 71 percent, behind labor shortages (80 percent) and supply chain challenges (77 percent).</p>
      <div class="sub-heading-container"><h4 class="sub-heading">Header:  Where to Begin</h4></div>
    <p class="content-body">In addition to competing priorities, some SME leaders (27 percent in the U.S. and 15 percent in Canada) don’t know where to being when adopting climate change policies. Businesses identified climate-related costs, a lack of clear government objectives and insufficient internal resources as the main barriers preventing them from moving forward. While larger companies can afford to carve out departments and tap external help to develop and implement climate policies, small and medium-sized businesses don’t have the same capacity.

      A quarter of business leaders cited cost as the biggest deterrent, with more than half of U.S. small and medium-sized businesses estimating that a climate change strategy would cost between $10,000 and $500,000 to implement in both the U.S. and Canada.</p>
